# Matching Game Project

## The Game

The Memory Game is a digital version of the classic memory games we all know from childhood, that can be _played in the browser_. There are 16 cards - 8 pairs - that all look the same on the backside. They are shuffled anew each time the game is played and you are allowed to _only turn two cards at a time_. Your goal is to find all the matching cards. Once a match is found the cards are not turned over again.  

## The Code

The code is spread between three files:
- index.html
- app.css
- app.js

The project uses:
- Bootstrap
- jQuery
- Google Web Fonts
- Font Awesome
- Hero Patterns

## How to run it

Run the game by _opening_ the **index.html** file in a browser.
